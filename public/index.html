        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Junior Computer Science student with a minor in Artificial Intelligence, aiming to pursue a graduate
            degree in the same field. Born and raised in San Diego, I have developed a logical and analytical mindset
            that serves me well in my studies. My passion for Computer Science drives me to excel, especially in areas
            that pique my interest, where my enthusiasm often reaches the point of obsession. My academic journey has
            been marked by strong test-taking skills and a deep love for problem-solving and innovation.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I dedicate my free time to training in Jiu Jitsu, snowboarding, and rock climbing.
            These activities not only keep me physically active but also help me maintain a balanced and focused life.
            My commitment to these hobbies reflects my determination and drive, qualities that I bring to both my
            personal and academic pursuits.</p>
